            /> --> <p> <span>July 21, 2024</span> </p> <p>It’s funny how we cope sometimes. Today is a “work” day for me to brush up on skills while searching for my next role. Just now, my wife caught me in the garage admiring a stick. I put the stick back in a hurry, embarrassed like a kid caught drawing on the wall.</p>
<p>“What.. are you doing?"<br>
"I’m, uh, looking at my stick. Look, isn’t this such a cool stick?”</p>
<p>I proceeded to show her how the stick tapers top to bottom with a perfect ratio, how the head curves beautifully into a shape for a hand to rest. “I picked this up in Southern Utah when I got lost in the desert,” I told her. She was kind to hear me out, and she listened with the same patience she affords the children when they beg for one more story before bedtime. We both knew I was stalling. “I should get back to work,” I conceded.</p>
<p>Coping is important with any major change. And how each person copes manifests differently as we oscillate between optimism and despair, as we untangle profession from identity. For me, this time, it was revisiting another time of vulnerability and uncertainty, where I found a stick that helped me climb out of an ancient landslide in the desert. Last week, it was overworking at the gym, and then eating half a tub of ice cream at 1 AM.</p>
<p>I don’t think there is one right or wrong way to go about this. I don’t think there is need for shame, either (that ice cream was delicious; I have no regrets). What we actually needed is to afford ourselves the same empathy that we typically reserve for others, even if we’re acting funny. It’s merely part of the process until we find the next foothold. “Paths that need to be taken will be taken. No need to kick rocks along the way.” - some fortune cookie, probably.</p>
<p>And remember the old Persian adage, “This, too, shall pass.” Or, as my friend Tony (the other Tony) likes to say, “It’ll buff.”</p>
<p>Until then, please, be kind to yourselves.</p>
