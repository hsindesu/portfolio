Today, I started Brazilian Jiujitsu (and thoroughly got my butt kicked). Seems I have a habit of starting hard things when life presents a challenge. 12 years ago, I started breakdancing to get over a heartbreak. It's not so different this time with Intuit's decision to shutdown its Boise site.
  
I got my butt thoroughly kicked today. I walked away from my first BJJ lesson sore and bruised, lightheaded from being nearly choked out, though I really enjoyed myself. Much like breakdancing, it's very much requires you to be in the moment, to be present (granted, in the case of BJJ, it's being present to getting your own ass-kicking). The rest of the world seems to fall away. You can't really worry the layout of your resume when you've got someone trying cut off the air supply to your head using your own arm.  
  
It was really hard. I had so exerted my energy and strength, I walked away shaking and nauseous. At the same time, I knew that I would be going back. My actual problems hadn't gone away, but the anxiety involved with job hunting, the daily email rejections, and the worry of failing my wife and children--all of that went away--because none of it is real. What's real is that someone is hyper-extending my arm. What's real is that I'd like to tap out but I can't find my other hand. What's also real is that I am currently without a job for the first time. But that's it. Only the real things are real.  
  
Someone once said "The hardest thing that's ever happened to you is the hardest thing that's ever happened to you." That is, to get past the hardest thing happening to you, it might help to find something harder to do. For me, that seems to be BJJ.Â For you, I hope you sign up for a dance class, jump out of a plane (please, with a skying diving instructor), or open up to someone and really be honest and vulnerable.  
  
Go do something hard to do (and be present).
