Well, it's finally the Monday after. The first after being laid off. The anxiety of getting the kids ready in order to make a meeting is now replaced with the anxiety of stillness after the children have left. This is my first time leaving a job involuntarily, and it kind of feels like the girl I like didn't like me back (anymore): I know I could've done better, and given the chance, I'd do it all over again.

Some things were probably better left unsaid, but the package isn't ungenerous. I'll have a few months to shore up skillsets that I know I've been lacking, get back into shape (and make those doctor's appointments), and finally patch up the drywall in the ceiling from when the shower drain failed.

It's time I'm not used to having, but time I have to fill nonetheless. I can't control her decisions, but I certainly have mine to make. There is a lot to get done before getting out there again, and I want to make sure I walk into the next chapter prepared, with more maturity, and with the wisdom I've received from the incredible individuals that I got to work with at Intuit.

There's no need to lawyer up, but I'm definitely hitting the gym. I didn't get the keep the apartment, but hey, at least I got to keep the friends.
